Together with my dear friend [Andr√©](https://hachyderm.io/@secret), I'm very excited to launch the first open-source project.

Indiepen is a simple, privacy-friendly and accessible tool to embed HTML, CSS & JS code examples. We were looking for an exciting service to embed code examples on our [tech blog](https://yetanother.blog), but we couldn't find anything matching our requirements. We believe in cookieless solutions, without tracking or a ton of features we don't need.

Indiepen is a lightweight solution for a modern, fast and fair web.

**UPDATE:** We are so thankful for all the support! Indiepen got [250+ stars on GitHub](https://github.com/yetanother-blog/indiepen/), [100+ upvotes on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/indiepen), got mentioned in several newsletters, including [JavaScript weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/544), and we could write about Indiepen in [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/cookieless-alternative-embed-html-css-js-code-examples/). Thank you so much! üôè
