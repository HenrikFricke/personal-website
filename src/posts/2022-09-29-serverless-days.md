After years of giving talks and workshops remotely, I could finally go on stage and give my first in-person workshop in Hamburg. ðŸ¥³ The workshop was mainly for beginners just starting with AWS and Serverless. In the three hours we have spent together, we built a simple REST API to store and retrieve data from a database using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. The workshop material is open-source and available on GitHub.
