In the last 2.5 years, I worked as a cloud consultant at [superluminar](https://superluminar.io) and helped clients to move their existing infrastructure to the cloud or implement new projects from scratch. With the support from all the talented people at superluminar, I learned a lot about running and operating microservices, automating developer workflows, and governing enterprise architectures.

At [WakeSys](https://wakesys.com/), I have the great honour to take the knowledge and build a completely new product using state-of-the-art technologies.
